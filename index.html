 <h2>Providing direction to trusted suppliers in the Greater Manchester community</h2>
 <h2>And Links to markets and trade fairs all over the Uk</h2>
 <br>
 <br>

 <h2>I provide details of some local suppliers, Events and markets in your area </h2>
 <p>Over the years I have used many companies,</p>
 <p>Suppliers, and local markets to build or upgrade computer systems.</p>
 <p>Whether they be top end new builds or used budget systems.</p>
 <p>All systems are bespoke to their end user.</p>
 <p>Not everybody has an unlimited budget and you may have to build systems on a shoestring.</p>
